# What should not be modified:
# 1. Anything inside < > brackets - these are special text formatting tags
# 2. Anything inside { } brackets - these are variables that will be replaced
#
# Do not remove {0} and similar variables - it can cause in-game errors!
#
# There is one exception to the rule above. When {0} is a curse adjective or adverb (friggin, etc)
# And it is stated so in the example, if your language cannot combine them well, you can try ommitting {0}
# In this case, but if there is more than one variable ({0}, {1}), you cannot remove {0} and leave {1}!
# You can remove the last variable ({1}) in this case, to keep the variable sequence running from {0}
# (only if {1} is a curse adjective / adverb)
#
# <br> is a line break
#
# It is highly recommended to keep every single key in same exact line as English - copy all the comments and blank lines
######################################

# Characters

# If you change any character names, you have to consistently keep using them
# Across all the translations where they are mentioned. Also in Tips.txt
# For this reason I suggest to keep names of Brace Stone and Nicholas Merryland 
# unchanged. Anonymous racer only appears in introduction cutscene.

# Cutscenes

### Lore Cutscene ### <-- please get this one very well, it's something people usually see within first 2 minutes of the game

# In here {0} is the number of years and {1} is a date
cut.lore.1,Hey! Aren't you that famous racer who got into a major accident {0} years ago? I know you've been in cryo-sleep since {1}, so let me bring you up to speed.
# {0} is a date
cut.lore.2,There was this highly successful technology corporation, one you should know about, I just can’t remember its original name right now. It eliminated its competition and took control of the global economy back in {0}.
# You should probably keep "Social Frontier of Activism" and SOFACT unchanged in your translation, for authenticity (company was not local after all)
cut.lore.3,Instead of seeking scientific discoveries, the corporation had been strangling itself with increasingly complex internal policies. At some point they renamed it to "Social Frontier of Activism", or SOFACT.
cut.lore.4,But eventually human nature took over. Activists were eliminated by force during an unexpected hostile takeover, and SOFACT, while still appearing as a friendly organization, now belongs to old school knuckleheaded thugs.
# Please do not translate "Bloody Rally Show", or included it into parentheses next to translation. Example: "Kruvinojo Ralio Šou" (Bloody Rally Show)
cut.lore.5,New leaders focused on profits. They kept investing into entertainment to maximize ad revenue, and "Bloody Rally Show" happens to be the entertainment of choice for most people these days.
cut.lore.6,In Bloody Rally Show they are trying to recreate the golden age of rallying by using technologies of 1980s, ones from the infamous Group B. The amount of accidents is sky high, but social media influencers keep trying to get those hot action close-up photos.
cut.lore.7,Don't lose your car my friend, or you may have to join the crowd. Now good luck, and godspeed! Oh, by the way, I didn't catch your name.

### Season Intro ### <-- please get this one very well too, it's part 2 of the main introduction

cut.intro.1,Hey, rookie, you're late! I am the director of Bloody Rally Show. There is someone else I'd like you to meet.
# {0} will be a random insult word
cut.intro.2,There you are, {0}. We brought you in since they say you know how to drive those old school race cars well. Now go make a good show!
cut.intro.2_2,Oh, and we will ask you to do us some favors from time to time. Nothing big, don't worry about it!
cut.intro.3,Wait a moment. Why do I have to do this for you?
# {0} will be an insult, ${1} - sum of money, like $500000
cut.intro.4,Because you owe us for the cryo-sleep, {0}! Repay ${1} at the end of any season and you're free to do anything you want. Until then your ass belongs to SOFACT.
cut.intro.5,Looks like I don't have much choice... When do I start?
cut.intro.6,Follow me rookie, I'll show you around. Let's meet the other racers first.
# {0} will be a plural insult (addressing all racers)
cut.intro.7,So, {0}, you're back for more? I'm impressed!
cut.intro.8,I still feel that there's something left for me to do, you know
cut.intro.9,Happy you're back! Now follow me, there are some papers you need to sign.
